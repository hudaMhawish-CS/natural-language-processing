Tweets Classification. Using of Natural Language Processing ,Machine Learning to collect tweets ,clean and classifying them (Python , NLTK)
** It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification
# Introduction
We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the tweets.
# Tweets Preprocessing and Cleaning
1. Data Collecting
2. Text Cleaning and Normalization
3. Extract features from the cleaned text using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
4. Text Analysis
5. build models using both the feature sets to classify the tweets.
